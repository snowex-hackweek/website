    "### What is the Mission of SnowEx?\n",
    "\n",
    "SnowEx is a multi-year program initiated and funded by the NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program to address the most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What are the core data sets and what makes them different from other data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data sets are standarized manual ground observations collected by SnowEx participants. These observations provide a legacy data set for the purposes of calibration and validation efforts for the remote sensing instruments. \n",

    "### What are depth transects? or simply depths = 'Point' data in the SnowEx database\n",
    "These are point meausurements that tell you how deep the snow is at georeferenced locations. There are several instruments available to capture snow depth, some of which are an avalanche probe, MagnaProbe, or Mesa2.   \n",

    "An interval board is a 2x2\" board with a vertical pole attached at the center. The board surface tracks the amount of new snow that falls between field visits. \n"
