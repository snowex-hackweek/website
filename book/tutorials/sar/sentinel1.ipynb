    "Sentinel-1 is a constellation of two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel-1 is the first SAR system with a global monitoring strategy and fully open data policy! S1A launched 3 April 2014, and S1B launched 25 April 2016. There are many observation modes for SAR, over land the most common mode is 'Interferometric Wideswath' (IW), which has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| frequency | resolution (rng x azi m) | swath width (km) | incidence (deg) |\n",
    "| - | - | - |  - |\n",
    "| C-band | 3x22 | 250 | 33-43 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most optical satellite observations, SAR antennas are pointed to either the right or left, resulting in an off-nadir incidence angle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [global observation plan](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario) for Sentinel-1 has changed over time, but generally over Europe, you have repeat acquisitions every 6 days, and elsewhere every 12 or 24 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite radar intruments record the *amplitude* and *phase* of microwaves that bounce off Earth's surface. These values can be stored as a single complex number, so you'll often encounter SAR images that store complex-valued arrays. {term}`InSAR`, or 'Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar', is a common processing pipline to generate phase-change maps or 'interferograms' (which can be related to tectonic surface displacements or snow properties) using two different SAR acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common data products you'll encounter for Sentinel-1 are {term}`GRD` (just amplitude) and {term}`SLC` (amplitude+phase). These are [level-1](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/data-information-policy/data-levels) that most scientific products are derived from. Level-1 data is typically stored in *radar* coordinates. At best you'll have ground control points (GCPs) stored in file metadata for approximate geocoding, but you need to use advanced processing pipelines to accurately geocode and generate higher level products {cite:p}`YagueMartinez2016`.\n",
