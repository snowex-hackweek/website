You can then plot them on the same axes.  We will do more of this in coming weeks to create plots of both raster and vector data sources.\n",
    "    * For most applications, best to avoid using a geographic projection (lat/lon) for analysis (or visualization) due to scaling issues\n",
    "    * In general, for local studies or smaller areas (<500x500 km), you can use the appropriate UTM zone, which has acceptable distortion in terms of distance, angles and areas\n",
    "    * For larger areas, probably want to define a custom projection or use common regional projection designed for your intended purpose\n",

    "In 2D, transforming (x,y) coordinates between different projections (e.g., WGS84 vs. UTM) on the same reference ellipsoid is pretty straightforward.  Things start to get more complicated when you include different ellipsoid models, horizontal/vertical datums, etc.  Oh, also the Earth's surface is not static - plate tectonics make everything more complicated, as time becomes important, and transformations must include a \"kinematic\" component.  \n",

It's been under development since the 1980s, and our understanding of the Earth's shape and plate motions has changed dramatically in that time period.  So, still pretty complicated, and there are different levels of support/sophistication in the tools/libraries that use `PROJ`.\n",
