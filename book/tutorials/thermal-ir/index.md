# Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing of Snow

**At the conclusion of this tutorial, you will be able to:**
- Understand the differences between sources of thermal IR observations, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and types of research questions we can address with those observations
- Access and visualize airborne and satellite thermal infrared imagery, then scale imagery of different spatial resolutions for comparison
- Visualize point and raster thermal infrared datasets together, then compute error statistics between point and raster datasets

## Why do we want thermal images of snow?

## How does thermal infrared remote sensing work?

## What kinds of data will we be using?
