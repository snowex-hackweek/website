[ASF](https://asf.alaska.edu)
  Alaska satellite facility. NASA distributed active archive center (DAAC) specializing 
  in radar products.

[Binder](https://mybinder.org)
  A free, public service for running reproducible interactive computing environments.
  Binder is a 100% open source infrastructure that is run by members of the Jupyter
  community. The underlying technology behind the Binder project is BinderHub.

[BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  The underlying technology of mybinder.org, BinderHub is an open source tool that
  utilizes a JupyterHub`= in order to provide live, reproducible interactive computing 
  environments that users define on GitHub.

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
  Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R, Ruby, Lua, 
  Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated 
  environment called a container. It is widely used for creating reproducible software 
  environments to run code on different computers.

[GitHub](https://github.com)
  Provider of Internet hosting for software development and distributed version control 
  using the "git" command line tool.

GRD
  "Ground range detected". Common real-valued georeferenced SAR amplitude product.

[Hackweek](https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/intro.html)
  Participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces to learn new things, 
  build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science.

InSAR 
  "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar". Method to create relative phase change
  maps or "interferograms" from two synthetic aperture radar acquisitions.

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
    Project Jupyter (name derived from "JUlia PYThon and R") exists to develop open-source 
    software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of 
    programming languages.

[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
    Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality 
    books and documents from computational material.

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    A core open source tool from the Jupyter community, JupyterHub allows you to
    deploy an application that provides remote data science environments to multiple
    users. It can be deployed in the cloud, or on your own hardware.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
    intended to replace the JupyterNotebook interface.

[JupyterNotebook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
    open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain 
    live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

RPI
  "Repeat pass interferometry". When two SAR acquistions of the same location are 
  acquired at different times.

[SnowEX](https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex)
  5-year NASA funded effort to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing 
  knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission.

SLC 
  "Single look complex". Common complex-valued SAR amplitude and phase product.

[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov)
  "Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar". Airborn L-band InSAR platform.
