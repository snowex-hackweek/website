# Earthdata Login

## Overview

NASA data are stored at one of several Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). If you're interested in available data for a given area and time of interest, the [Earthdata Search](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) portal provides a convenient web interface.

## Why do I need an Earthdata login?

Each participant will need a login. We will be teaching you ways to programmatically access NASA data from within your Python scripts. You will need to enter your Earthdata username and password in order for this to work.

## Getting an Earthdata login

If you do not already have an Earthdata login, then navigate to the [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) page, a username and password, and then record this somewhere for use during the tutorials:
