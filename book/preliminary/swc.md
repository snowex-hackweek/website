# Software Carpentry Training

We will host a SnowEx hackweek Software Carpentry training on June 21 - 22. 
This event is by invitation to SnowEx hackweek participants only.

The purpose of this training is to help everyone gain skills in fundamental data science tools.
By offering this work in advance of the hackweek we can maximize the amount of time we get to focus on SnowEx data! 
Feel free to contact one of us if you need more clarity on deciding whether this would be a good use of your time.

## Time Zones

All times listed below are UTC -7 (Pacific Daylight Time).
You might want to consult this [Time Zone Map](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/) 
to figure out times in your location.


## Getting ready

Please take a minute before the workshop to go over the [GitHub instructions](github), 
create an account, and enter your username in 
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6T_TZ8cfwRSvYJClAmsun38SM5IPH6EzyZJFZGgeXqIuL_g/viewform) 
so we can add you to the SnowEx hackweek GitHub organization.

We will be using the JupyterHub ({{ jupyterhub_url }}) throughout this workshop. 
We encourage you to test your [connection to JupyterHub](jupyterhub) at any time before the training.
