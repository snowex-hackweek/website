# Pangeo

## What is Pangeo?

[Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) is a community of researchers building open, reproducible
and scalable scientific software tools. Several of the UW eScience Hackweek organizers
are involved in [projects with NASA and NSF](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/access/eos-data-cloud)
to build prototype systems to enable data discovery in the era of expanding data
volume and complexity.

### How we are using it for this {{ hackweek }}?

For this hackweek, we have created virtual computing instances on
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) that can be deployed on demand in
a parallel computing environment. We use JupyterHub as a way to give a Jupyter
Notebook server to each person of the {{ hackweek }}.
[These slides](https://www.slideshare.net/willingc/jupyterhub-a-thing-explainer-overview)
give a nice overview of what JupyterHub is all about. We use JupyterHub in an
educational setting because it enables us to quickly begin working with code
without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on
everyone's individual computers.
