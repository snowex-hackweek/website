The purpose of {{ hackweek }} is to foster an environment of collaboration and sharing of [NASA SnowEx](https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex) datasets across teams. We will teach each other about open source software during tutorials, and build new tools together during project work. Our vision is to create a space for networking, innovation and the sharing of ideas.
